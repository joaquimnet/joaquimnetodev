# Hello World

I've been putting off remaking my site for a while now.
The old one looked good, yes. But it was getting harder to maintain and expand upon. It was made React and CSS from scratch.

<Image
  src="/images/001-old-site.png"
  alt="Header, Blog"
  width={645}
  height={571}
  priority
  className="next-image"
/>

## The new site

This site is a Next.js site. It uses the blog example with Nextra for the MDX stuff. I'm planning on customizing it more in the future to make it more... me.

This site has 3 goals.

- Say who I am.
- Show what I do.
- Share my thoughts.

## That's it

Thank you for listening, world. ðŸ‘‹
